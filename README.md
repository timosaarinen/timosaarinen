Founder/CTO of Islefire Ltd. I’ve also recently worked on Naama.Online, a social platform project close to my heart — though now slightly paused after the loss of my co-founder.

🎮 I've been building things since the ’90s — from early 3D game engines to modern AI-assisted dev tools. With roots in the game industry since 1995, I still get excited about clever code, creative tools, and challenging systems.

🛠️ These days I’m hacking on Promptly, a local-first AI dev companion — and (more than) a few game experiments.

💬 Always up to talk tech, tools, engines, weird UIs, or how to bend reality with pixels.
